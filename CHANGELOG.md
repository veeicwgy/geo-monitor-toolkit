# Changelog

## Unreleased

## v0.2.4

### Changed
- Reduced the root ClawHub skill to a read-only workflow router so shell execution is no longer requested from the main entry point.
- Declared optional environment variables and local binary requirements in `metadata.openclaw` for the root skill and `visibility-monitor`.
- Reworded quickstart and API collection guidance so users keep secrets in local environment variables instead of chat prompts.
- Aligned root and sub-skill manifest versions to `0.2.4` for the scanner-compliance republish.

## v0.2.3

### Changed
- Replaced the old logo asset with a new AI Visibility Toolkit wordmark in both SVG and PNG formats.
- Restored the logo to the top of the English and Chinese README files so the new public brand is visible at first glance.

## v0.2.2

### Changed
- Renamed the public repository and skill brand to **AI Visibility Toolkit**.
- Switched the preferred CLI entry point to `python -m ai_visibility` while keeping a legacy alias for existing automation.
- Renamed packaged sub-skills to `visibility-monitor`, `visibility-content-check`, `visibility-repair`, and `visibility-query-matrix`.
